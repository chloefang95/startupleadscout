"Python backend" terminal
This terminal is where you have been running your FastAPI backend server (with uvicorn app.main:app --reload).
You see FastAPI logs, API requests, and error messages here.
This is the terminal you should use to restart your backend server.

"bash" terminal
This terminal is just a regular shell prompt.
You can use it for anything: running commands, installing packages, testing with curl, etc.
You tried to start the server here, but got Address already in use because the backend was already running in the other terminal.
Summary
Always start/stop/restart your FastAPI server in the terminal where you see the FastAPI logs (your "Python backend" terminal).
Use the other terminal for testing, installing, or running other commands.

To restart:
In the "Python backend" terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the server.
Then run:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
